    "\n",
    "Regularization is the method of reducing overfitting of the model by reducing the magnitude or the values of the parameters/coefficients (For example the m and c in the linear regression equation) of the input variables/features by introducing a penalty for the parameters. The amount of penalty is based on how high the value to the parameters are, the higher the value of the parameter higher the penalty.  This is done by introducing a regularization parameter (lambda) for the parameters (m and c) specifically as part of the cost function to be minimized by the learning algorithm or machine learning algorithm.\n",
